# Final Project Milestones

This set of milestones is designed to guide you through the final stages of your project development. Each milestone will help you progress step-by-step, from exploring your data to structuring, developing, and refining your visualizations in a website. Regularly revisiting and updating your work will ensure a successful final project.

---

## Milestone 1: Exploring Data and Making Basic Visualizations
**Objective**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to validate your project scope and identify preliminary challenges.

1. **Create Preliminary Visualizations**:
   - Use basic visualizations to explore your data, check for patterns, and test whether your initial questions are answerable with the data you have.
   
2. **Identify Challenges and Limitations**:
   - Reflect on any difficulties with the data (e.g., missing values, unexpected data formats).
   - Identify any limitations that may require adjusting your scope.

3. **Update Scope and Visualization Needs**:
   - Revise your project scope based on insights from data exploration.
   - Make a list of the visualizations you will need in the final project.

**Deadline**: November 14

## Milestone 2: Prototyping and Structuring Your Visualizations
**Objective**: Plan and structure your website layout and visualizations using wireframes.

1. **Create a Website Layout in Figma**:
   - Design the structure for your project website, showing where each visualization will go.
   - Explain why each visualization is placed where it is (consider readability, user flow, and interaction).

2. **Plan Tools and Roles**:
   - Identify any tools you may need for creating specific visualizations or interactive features.
   - If working in a group, assign roles and responsibilities.

3. **Plan for Any Difficulties**:
   - Note any areas where you may need additional support (e.g., programming assistance).

**Deadline**: November 14

## Milestone 3: Developing the Visualizations in the Website
**Objective**: Start building the visualizations and integrating them into your website.

1. **Establish Your Website Structure**:
   - Set up the basic framework for your website, focusing on structure and navigation.

2. **Develop Visualizations**:
   - Begin coding visualizations in D3, Vega-Lite, or other tools, aiming to have a working version of each.
   - Experiment with different ways of integrating visualizations into the website and making them interactive.

3. **Refine and Test Visualizations**:
   - Continue iterating on visualizations and adjusting based on feedback or new insights.

**Deadlines**:
   - Initial Progress: November 21
   - Continued Development: November 28
   - Final Revisions: December 3

## Milestone 4: Putting It All Together
**Objective**: Finalize your website by ensuring cohesion, responsiveness, and design quality.

1. **Refine Website Content and Layout**:
   - Add any necessary text or explanations to enhance user understanding.
   - Ensure the website is well-organized and cohesive in both design and functionality.

2. **Optimize for Responsiveness**:
   - Test your website on various devices to ensure it is responsive across different screen sizes.

3. **Seek Feedback**:
   - Continuously ask for feedback on design, usability, and clarity, and make adjustments as needed.

**Final Due Date**: December 10
